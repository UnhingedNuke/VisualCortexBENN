# VisualCortexBENN
The Visual Cortex BENN(Biological Emulation Neural Network) is a machine learning model designed to identify, discern, and recreate different images at a rate exponentially faster than other learning models by using an emotionally based learning algorithm that closely mimicks the actual neuron firing pattern to, within, and from the visual cortex within the human brain.
