# VisualCortexBENN
The Visual Cortex BENN(Biological Emulation Neural Network) is a machine learning model designed to identify, discern, recreate, different images at a rate exponentially faster than other learning models by using an emotionally based learning algorithm that closely mimicks the actual neuron map to, within, and from the visual cortex.
